    "\n",
    "For decades, a large part of the increase of the performance of CPU was driven by the rapid inflation of the number of transistors (roughly doubling the number of transistors per unit area every couple of years) going in hand in hand with a constant boost of the clock frequency. Unfortunately over the past decade progress has been modest. The miniaturization of transitors has become increasingly more difficult and heat dissipation is now a major issue preventing further increase in clock frequency. To keep improving the performance, CPU makers have switched to an alternative strategy, putting several processing cores in a single CPU die, yielding in principle speed improvements proportional to the number of cores. However writing a software that efficiently uses several cores can be (much) more difficult than simply using just one core.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of some fundamental elements in its architecture (see [GIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock)), the main Python implementation, CPython, makes it very difficult to write efficient parallel programs in Python. Over the years, various methods have been put forward to overcome this issue. I present here one such approach: process-based parallelism. This is a high-level parallelism. Rather than parallelizing individual mathematical operations, we do so at the highest level possible. This is ideal for running many independent tasks such as computing models over a grid (each process computes entirely one model based on different input parameters, with several processes doing so in parallel), fitting these grids of models to different objects (each process does all the fitting for one object, with several processes doing so in parallel), or generating series of plots for instance (each process entirely generates one plot, with several processes doing so in parallel).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the examples presented below are generally not optimal as for the sake of demonstration they do only very simple things and we are most likely dominated by overheads. For the best gain possible, the parallelization should be done on the longest running tasks possible.\n",

    "We will implement parallel computation using python's multiprocessing module. When starting a parallel computation it forks (Linux/OS X) or spawns (Windows) a new process. However from experience when Numpy is linked with certain optimized numerical libraries, using fork triggers a deadlock on OS X (in theory on Linux too but I have never run into the problem). To avoid that we will settle on using spawn, which creates entirely new processes independent from the parent process (fork basically just does a minimal cloning, keeping a lot of shared elements). This will require Python 3.4+. If you have an earlier version, it may or may not work. The downside of using the spawn start method is that it is much slower than fork to generate the child processes. So one needs to make sure that it is only used for long running tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important point is that the multiprocessing module does not get along well with interactive python sessions when the functions to be run in parallel are defined within the interactive session. To work around this issue, we import these functions from the pyastro16 module. Feel free to peruse and modify this module at your leisure."

    "So far we have remained in a simple case: the parallel functions just take one or a few scalar arguments and the results are provided in the form of a list return by Pool.map() or Pool.starmap(). However it can be the case that these functions need a lot more information than this (for instance large Numpy arrays containing spectra, light curves, etc.) and/or that they return several quantities that would be better stored directly into a Numpy array (lists are not only slow compare to Numpy arrays for numerical data, they are also quite inefficient in terms of RAM usage, which can be a problem when you output GB worth of data).\n",
    "\n",
    "A na√Øve solution would be to pass these arrays as arguments. However as we use the \"spawn\" method each child process would immediately make a full separate copy of it for its exclusive usage. Not only is this slow, it could also rapidly engulf a significant fraction of the RAM if the arrays are not small and in any case it means that we cannot use such arrays to store the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiprocessing.sharedctypes module actually provides us with objects that can be shared between children processes: Value and Array, which contain respectively a scalar and (surprise!) an array. They come with a lock to read or write the data. This is useful if you read/write an element with one process that can be read/written by another process. If you read an array that is never modified or write to an array where you are certain that no two processes will ever write at the same location, then you can rather use RawValue and RawArray. These functions return a c_type object, which is basically a pointer to an appropriately sized block of RAM. There are two obvious problems that pop up here. First, we want to deal with a Numpy array and all its niceties, not a cold, raw block of RAM. The second problem is that (Raw)Array have no notion of the shape of the array. We will deal with these issues in time. But let's start with a very simple example first as there are a few delicate points to get this working properly.\n"

    "Here we have created a simple shared counter. Each time a child process is called it locks the object to make sure no other child process can modify the counter, it increments the counter, and finally it releases the lock. The second version increments without invoking a lock. We see that the final count is not correct in such case. This is because several child processes incremented the counter at the same time from the same initial value. Beyond these findings, there are also two important and related points to notice: 1. the counter is not passed as an argument, 2. mp.Pool() was called with two arguments. Because counter is a variable that will be shared between processes, it cannot really be considered as an argument. Rather it should be seen as a sort of global variable. This is where the initializer and initargs come into play. If counter is a global variable, the child processes must be made aware of its existence. The initializer argument takes a function. This function is called once when each child process is created. It takes the arguments from initargs. The trick then is to use the initializer to declare the initarg variables as global variables. Then they will be accessible to read/write within each child process while actually existing in only one location in RAM so they are effectively shared across child processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how to share variables between all the child processes, we can go back to the question of dealing with (multidimensional) Numpy arrays rather than multiprocessing.sharedctypes arrays. So we need to find a way to tell the child processes to convert the (Raw)Arrays into Numpy arrays of any dimension without losing their shared-memory properties. For that we do two things. First, instead to passing the (Raw)Array to the initializer we pass a tuple containing the (Raw)Array and its dimension. Then in the initializer we read the (Raw)Array as a Numpy array and we reshape this array into the right dimension. In effect the Numpy array points to the same memory block as the (Raw)Array. Here is a simple example where we use such a strategy to create random numbers."

    "Using multiprocessing induces large startup overheard simply because starting child processes with the spawn method can take of the order of hundreds of ms. This means that the total run time should at least be a few times this value for the parallelization to be worthwhile. This also suggests that the parallelization should be done at the highest level possible. For instance when fitting models to data from different objects, it is more efficient that each child process handles the whole fitting process for one object rather than fitting objects in series and parallelizing only specific parts of the fitting process (for example the computation of the $\\chi^2$, etc.). If you cannot parallelize at a high level, multiprocessing is probably not the method you want to use to parallelize your computation and you may be better off with OpenMP/MPI for instance.\n",

However when running on multiple cores, they compete to access the RAM and they can end up spending a non negligible fraction of their time waiting for the RAM to send the data over. Make sure you access the memory efficiently, reading contiguous blocks. Naturally having a computer with a faster memory such as DDR4 rather than DDR3 won't hurt.\n",

For each physical core, this creates two virtual logical cores. This allows the operating system to optimize the scheduling of processing, for instance by scheduling out a process that is waiting data from the RAM to schedule in another process whose requested data has arrived in the meantime. The actual gain is very dependent on the workload but in my experience it is a good rule of thumb to parallelize with as many processes as there are logical cores. Going further is detrimental and will likely slow down everything as processes have to be scheduled in and out more often than necessary.\n",
